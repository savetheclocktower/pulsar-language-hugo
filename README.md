# language-hugo package

Adds a grammar for the Go Templating system used by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Using this grammar for `.html` files

Hugo gives template files the `.html` extension. To have Pulsar prefer this grammar over the built-in HTML grammar for `.html` files, [follow these instructions](https://docs.pulsar-edit.dev/customizing-pulsar/customizing-language-recognition/).

If youâ€™d like this behavior only on certain projects, [atomic-management](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/packages/atomic-management) or [project-config](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/packages/project-config) will let you define this setting in a project-specific overrides file.
